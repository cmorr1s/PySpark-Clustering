# PySpark-Clustering
This was a project that I worked on  utilizing PySpark during my graduate program.

The notebook works on a dataset of customer flight data for a US airline. My role on the project was to clean, aggregate and run K-Means clustering on the aggregated data set. Other group members ran other clustering algorithms but they are not shown in this notebook.
